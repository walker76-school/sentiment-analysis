My +1 does not need or want to be connected at all times. He had an older, inexpensive droid that he disliked from day one. It stopped working. This phone with the tracfone service suits him. It's a bit of a pain to program since there is no "keyboard", but I knew that going in. I got it set up, added favorites and he was good to go. Made a couple calls from it and the calls were clear no static or breaking up. Battery has had good life, though he has not used it for much talk time. It seems durable enough. Have not connected it to Blue Tooth as of yet. If you are into texting, this phone would likely not be a good choice, though you can send and received texts, no keyboard could be a deal breaker. If you just want a basic phone , this phone may work for you too. As of now most pleased with the purchase.
