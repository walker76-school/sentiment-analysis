I bought this to replace a beloved Alcatel Big Easy flip that had served me well for six years. I'm picky and biased about my personal phones. I love this phone! All the files on my sd card were read and transferred by the MyFlip easily! This phone isn't crippled up by the carrier, either. Call quality and signal is wonderful! Easy texting and big buttons. It's just a great flip phone that's affordable as well!
