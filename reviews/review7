This phone is easy to use, setup and view. The features are many for a flip phone. The only reason for the low rating is the battery life, which seems to be only 2-3 days without using the phone. Frequently, we find it dead and need to charge it because we are accustomed to another flip with a much longer battery life. Remembering to charge it almost daily would suffice to keep the phone, but it is a disappointment.
