The phone is mostly fine, but its achilles heel is the fact that texting is BRUTAL. Not because of T9, but because the keys are very glitchy. For example, I just tried to type 'Good morning how are you?" out quickly and it came out as: "good morning 66how are you7?6" Not sure if the keys stick or what, but it makes what would otherwise be a decent phone really awful to use. Very unsatisfied with quality in that department. Would not recommend.
