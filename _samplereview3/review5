It's OK as a heart rate monitor and maybe pedometer, but the app is absolutely horrible for much else. I can't consistently get it to show me activities--even those that I start on the monitor. And it only shows my resting heart rate in the log. Recently, I spent most of my day in a car. Then it told me I had hit the default goal of 10,000 steps. The app and instructions are poorly translated. Except for my heart rate, Google Fit--which came free on my phone--can do a better job than this app and device combo.
