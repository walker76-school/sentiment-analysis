This is a nice and simple tool to keep track of basic heart rate and steps. The sleep function seems to only work during certain hours and does not want to track naps. At first there was a tingle when the sensor would activate, annoying, but my wrist got used to the sensor. I tend to wear it reverse of a watch so I can check the time with just a glance while working with students. I like how long the battery lasts as well as the memory in the piece itself. I am going to see if I can make adjustments online where I cannot seem to through my phone's app. There is a bright light... tighten the strap to your skin and you will not see it. Luckily the light is green and not blue so it does not affect your sleep rhythm if it does shine on you.
