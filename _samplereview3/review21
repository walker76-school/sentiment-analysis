I purchased this product and received it on time and as expected. When I opened the box and charged it our was impressed with the simplicity of the product and the functionality of it. The price for this fitness tracker is beyond unbelievable. I love this tracker. It's light weight, durable, stylish, practicable, and easy to use. The app has a lot of functions. I wore this overnight to track my sleep pattern and couldn't tell it was on. I owned another tracker by a well known major brand and I enjoy this one much more better.
