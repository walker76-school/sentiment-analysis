I was not expecting the best performing tracker for the price but I was hoping for something fairly accurate. I already own a Fitbit 2 but since it is not waterproof I thought I would try this based on the good reviews. Not sure if the folks giving the good reviews actually purchased the product or have no clue about their steps, but this item is not accurate. I wore my Fitbit to compare and there was a difference of 2,500 steps. I was willing to overlook a few hundred but this is ridiculous. It under counted my steps every single time I walked. I'm sending it back.
