I have never thought about using a fitness tracker before. Because Most of them are too expensive to me. But when I saw this great price tracker, I decided to try it. I have used it for about a month now, I wear it every time when I do exercises. It works quite well, and help me to keep a more proper way in exercise s. It is easy to be charged and the battery can last quite long time, about three to five days. I can see the date and time on it. It shows the step count on the screen. The app functions well. But I found the screen is not sensitive enough when I touch it. I tried many times when I used it the first time, then I found the sensitive part of the screen.
Overall, there is no problem with my device for now. It is really a good tracker for the price. Like it!
