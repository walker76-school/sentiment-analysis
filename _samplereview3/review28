This fitness tracker, while looks nice, is completely ineffective. The heart rate sensor is wacky, only accurately records when it's tightly on your wrist and you are not moving. The band itself is extremely fragile and flimsy, and considering that the device itself barely lasts 4days before requiring a charge, you're bound to end up breaking the band in an effort to get it off to charge. Steps below a certain amount are NOT logged (i.e. If you walk 20 steps, it'll show temporarily on the watch but will clear it within a few seconds, and will not record it to the app.)
