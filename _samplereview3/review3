Not even close to correctly tracking steps. I contacted the seller and did the requested reboot, etc but here's the thing - if you take less than 30 steps and then stop, the steps aren't counted. If you take less than 100, those steps are DELETED! I'm a teacher, I walk A LOT, but it's stop and go so most of my walking doesn't even count! I'm printing that return label and sending it on it's way back.
