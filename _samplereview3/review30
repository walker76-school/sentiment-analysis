This fitness tracker is better than I thought it would be. I'd spent $40 on one from Walmart and was ready to return it that day because it was way off on everything it was supposed to do. This one is accurate about 98% of the time tracking steps. The heart rate monitor is off but that doesn't bother me. It did count steps while I was folding laundry so I took it off until I was done. It doesn't happen often enough to bother me. Just twice it tracked while I wasn't walking. So I'm just careful about that. The sleep tracker works great as well. It's comfortable to wear to bed and doesn't bother me at all. It gives the exact time you go to sleep and tracks deep sleep and light sleep. The instructions that come with the tracker are easy to follow and the app is easy to use. It also holds a really good charge. I'm really impressed with this product and I recommend it. I was looking at fitbits and came across this one. I'm glad I bought it. It's worth the money.
