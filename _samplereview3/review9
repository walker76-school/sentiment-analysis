The product has a nice and sleek design and it works pretty well in all the areas but the one I wanted it for most.
The sleep tracker does not work all the time. I purchased it based on the reviews stating that it works well in that department but it has been highly inconsistent. Some nights it'll record sleep, sometimes it won't. The package came with an email address for support which I emailed a week ago and have gotten no reply. It seems to be a pretty good device but the service I received around my issue (or the lack thereof) is really my problem. I am not a fan of leaving negative reviews and I always prefer giving the seller a chance to resolve my issues so that I don't have to, but in this case they failed to do so.
