When I first received this activity tracker, I thought it seemed like it was a very good alternative to a fitbit. However, a month after using it it would randomly stop syncing and I would have to manually sync through the app on the phone. I have now had it for two months and currently, in addition to it not syncing, four times it has randomly reset itself to 12:00 am. After several hours it would usually go back to the correct time but it is currently 48 hours since the last 12:00 reset and it has still not fixed itself. I am very disappointed in this and unfortunately, did not have the option to return it.
