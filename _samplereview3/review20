This works well for tracking steps and keeping track of your sleep which is what I primarily use it for. I think you get a descent product for the price. I REALLY like that there's no extra cord for charging. You just take off the band to plug the unit in a USB. I also like the options for screen designs. My only complaints would be:
1. The strap to hold the band down isn't very sturdy. It slides out of place real easily.
2. Once you unlink the device from your phone all the data is gone. It would be nice if the data stayed so if you get a new device you can continue from where you left off.
3. There seems to be a glitch with the text notification part or maybe it's just my phone.... I really like this but had to turn it off cause I keep getting an old text that I've already seen keep popping up on my screen.
