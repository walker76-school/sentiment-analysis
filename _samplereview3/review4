I purchased this watch because, let be honest, Ii am too cheap to buy a Fitbit. This watch looks and feels great, and has all of the features I was looking for in a fitness watch. The app is really nice, it did not take long at all to sync the watch. The only thing that was weird was the sleep monitoring. The first night I wore it, it did not monitor my sleep. I figured there was a setting I missed or something. The second night it worked fine without me doing anything. Overall I would definitely recommend this watch.
