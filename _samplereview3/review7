Since the day I got this unit, only couple of weeks ago, i have had issues with its charging and, once charged, it would hold the charge for less than 24 hrs when the battery again would start flashing. If the battery drains, i would have to reconnect it again to my phone and do a full reset, thus loosing some of the entries. And the final straw was earlier this morning: it simply won't charge. I have tried several USB chargers and it has been plugged in to its regular PC port and still no go. I will try to return and see what happens but beware the glowing reviews: there are bad units out there and you might get one of them.
