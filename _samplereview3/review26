I was intrigued by this fitness tracker after my Fitbit charge finally died. I was excited to have some of the same features at a fraction of the price. As usual, you do get what you pay for. First thing that wasn't super thrilling was it only tracks sleeping that occurs at night. If you are a napper like me, or you work at night, this is not the sleep tracker you are looking for. Sure this isn't that big of a deal so I continued to use it. Second huge drawback was after several months of use the tracker began to randomly vibrate and flash the display. You would think you were getting a notification but it was in fact just vibrating for the pure joy I assume. I literally had to stop wearing it because it was so distracting from everyday life. In the end I know now that the cheaper items aren't going to last in the long run.
