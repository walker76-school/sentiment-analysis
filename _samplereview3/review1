I am extremely satisfied with this watch. In my opinion, it is better than some Fitbits. I got the purple one and my brother got the black one. We are so happy with them. Here are the good things and bad things about it:
1. It is so accurate in counting our steps, calories burnt, and time exercised. I admit I was slightly worried about this part.
2. The commercial says it is waterproof, but i highly doubted that it would actually be waterproof, as only the best Fitbits are. However, I accidentally took it with me to a bubble bath, and it stayed underwater for about an hour, and it was perfectly fine.
3. It has so many different modes, even more than my friends legit Fitbit. It has walk mode, run mode, bike mode, soccer mode, tennis mode, dance mode, etc.
4. It is so comfortable. You also dont need a cable to charge it. You can switch bands and colors and it is so simple.
