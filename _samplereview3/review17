I bought this tracker thinking to combine my need for a watch with a device to replace my Fitbit Flex - one device to wear instead of two. Good idea, bad purchase! Like some others, I soon discovered that this device is highly inaccurate.
There are a few positive features about the LETSCOM. It's simple to set up, using the app I installed on my phone. Battery life seems to be excellent. Also, the method of cable-free charging is truly ingenious, an innovation I'd love to see in other devices. The band is plenty sturdy with lots of slots to allow adjustment for most wrist sizes.
But I need more than a pretty face! I need a tracker that registers all steps equally, not just those logged when I go out on the neighborhood trails. Most of my steps are from walking back and forth through my house and yard or chasing my grandkids around the playroom. As others have mentioned, the tracker resets to 0 if steps don't meet a certain minimum requirement.
Sadly, the LETSCOM has also failed as a watch. Supposedly I should be able to turn my wrist and activate the display. Nope, not after the first day or two. I have to tap the "button" to wake the screen, doable but inconvenient.
So after two and a half weeks of continual use, I guess I will consider this purchase a failure. Now to start looking for a new watch...
