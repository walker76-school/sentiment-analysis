I wanted something inexpensive, but quality to track my steps at work and my sleep. I am really impressed with this for the price. I average around 12,000 steps a day and I was shocked to see how little deep sleep that I actually get ( assuming it is accurate). I also like that I can get my messages and calls on it. I teach preschool and if the call isn't important, I don't want to have to check my phone. I also like being able to set up alarm alerts as well. It was especially nice this winter when I was able to get the texts that school was delayed or canceled without even getting out of bed! I would definitely recommend this to someone looking for a fitbit type tracker, but doesn't want to spend the money. I plan on ordering other colored bands and wish they would come out with a fancier metal type one for dressier occasions like church.
