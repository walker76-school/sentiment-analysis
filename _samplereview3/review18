Welp....I like that this has multiple functions....watch, sleep monitor, step counter, etc. It announces calls with a quiet vibration that makes it perfect for alerts during business meetings without having to look at my phone. It fits well and was easy to synchronize with my iPhone.  So. Why the one star rating? The heart monitor is completely inaccurate. The sleep monitor works perfectly if you fall asleep the moment you lay down. (If you read, play on your phone, watch TV, etc....it will still count you as sleeping.) Perhaps the biggest disappointment is how utterly inaccurate the step counter is. (Now...in all fairness....I do not wildly flap my arms while I walk. If I did madly gesticulate while walking I do not doubt this would count my steps.) But I hold my phone, walk with my calendar open, carry a cup of coffee, push a grocery cart, put my hands in my coat pockets to keep the warm outside...etc....and not one of those steps is counted. So basically this does not count many activities of daily living. I am going to try to flap wildly whilst walking for a couple of days just to see how how many steps I actually take. Ugh.
