For the price it is an okay value, and it has a good battery life 5-7 days on a few hours of charge. I Enjoyed the sleep tracking info, and learning more about how i sleep. HOWEVER!! This step tracker is totally inaccurate, I counted my steps one morning for my first hour. I was at 76 steps for the first hour, this tracker was telling me i had taken 266 steps. Then while i was sitting at the breakfast table writing this review the counter went from 266 steps to 416. How could i take almost 200 steps while sitting down writing a review?? This thing is pretty much a total joke and waste of money! It does receive messages, so if you are looking for a wrist band that will alert you to text messages its a must have! The other cons about this thing is that its annoying to sleep with a watch on your wrist. After my third night of trying to sleep with it on, it came off. I Cant stand sleeping with it on, it lights up when I move around. It also flashes green lights on my wrist at night in order to monitor me, but it only annoys me. So i wont using it much at night. Its as basic as they come and i don't think i will waste my money buying any more fitness trackers high end or low end. Its a stupid idea to pay for a device to tell you you've walked 5000 steps a day,especially when it tells you you've walked a 1000 steps while really sitting on your backside.
