The measurements are fairly accurate, count your steps, heart rate or even do sleep tracking. you can do all of them and more with this. The band is soft and the tracker is very comfortable to wear. It looks like fitbit, has more features than Fitbit but only cost a fraction of it. I only have to charge once a week or so, which is very good. Even for charging, Just take the band out and plug it directly to USB port, no need of additional wire. Notification on your wrist for email/txt etc is very handy feature.
