Love the battery life and the slim design. It looked nice and did not feel cheap at all. However, the translated-into-English manual was confusing. But the reason I returned it is that it did not count steps. I walked all over Target, glancing often at my wrist and the step count never changed. When i got to my car and looked yet again, the count had suddenly jumped by 200 steps. I have no way of knowing if it is accurate at all. And two days after I received mine, the price drops by $5. I am just to save my money for a more expensive but reliable activity tracker.
