I had bought this for my daughter because she wanted one since my mother already had one. It works impressively perfect and accurate detailed. When my mother saw this one, she was a bit jealous because the numbers on the watch were big enough for her see them with out her bifocals and could read the different readings better. The battery on this product lasts a good few days without needing a charge also. The band for the wrists are made of strong and flexible material. What is also not mentioned in the neet features is that when paired with the phone, it can take pictures. Although it is not saved on the watch, the watch does the clicking of the pictures. The Alarm feature could be improved by adding a sound and volume.
