I really wanted to like this product, but my primary reason for purchasing it was to have an accurate pedometer and it did not work at all. This item would not count my steps unless there were over 100 within a preset time limit (I don't remember what the time limit was). Anything less than 100 steps may have been counted, but would disappear within a few minutes if the minimum number of 100 was not met. It was also not super accurate even when counting over 100 steps. I'm using my husband's Fitbit now and loving it.
