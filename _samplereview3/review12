Fairly accurate and a great price. The step counter is very accurate, the heart rate monitor is accurate but only when the watch is positioned perfectly enough on your wrist that it rests snuggly against your skin. Exercise some common sense when judging the heart rate monitor, your doctor would not just barely touch your wrist or not at all to check your heart rate so neither should this. So far the waterproof part seems to be holding up very well!! I am impressed as I have submerged my hand in a 4 foot sink at work and still no problems. The watch itself requires an app for updates and such. The app could use a few tweaks. The activities option on the watch allows you to choose from 3 different activities to load to your watch but definitely needs to have a lot more options and at least allow 4 or 5 different ones rather than 3. And maybe some more clock options. Just throwing out some suggestions. Regardless overall it was a great activity watch for a great price and I will buy again.
