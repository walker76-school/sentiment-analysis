I've been using this fitness tracker for just over a week now. It's the first one I've ever purchased so I cannot compare it to any others. However, I do find it useful. It tells me the time (that's good) and it vibrates when I get messages on my iPhone with partial text if too long, and other notifications like calls, etc. You can select different modes like walking, running, sleeping and it tracks that stuff for you. Works really well. Considering the price I think it is pretty cool. I've only charged it once when I got it and it is still going on the original charge, so I'm glad I don't have to recharge too often.

On the negative side, I don't like having to take one side of the band off to recharge. Wish it could just be plugged in without removing the band, but that's a minor issue.
