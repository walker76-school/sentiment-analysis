Perfect, exactly what I was looking for. It's small and neutral color. Easy to understand and use. At first I was frustrated because my steps were not being logged. I wasn't aware that you need to swing your arm for it to count. This can also then make simple arm movement while plunging a toilet or sorting clothes to be counted as steps. Just be aware of this. I am aware now and make a conscious effort to walk more. I love this watch. I plan to by two more as gifts.
