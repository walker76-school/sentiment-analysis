This is an inexpensive tracker, perfect for a person like me who mostly wants to keep track of steps/miles. I had to read the directions a few times before I got it set up correctly and am still not sure how the heart rate tracker works. I wish the band was made of fabric, not rubber, and was thinner and lighter weight. I would buy this tracker again because it does what I want and I understand (mostly) how it works.
