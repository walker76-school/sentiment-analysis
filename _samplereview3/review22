This is the third fitness tracker I've purchased. My first was a Garmin and my second was a FitBit. I liked the Garmin because it was fully waterproof and the display was easy to read in sunlight. I liked the FitBit for the text/phone call notifications and the great App. But for under $30, I am more than satisfied with my LETSCOM. It's water-resistant, I get text notifications, it has a heart rate monitor and the display is easy to read. I do feel the App could be improved (reason for 4 stars), but honestly, I use it mainly as a watch and to track my steps. The customer service is top-notch. I had an issue with part of my band breaking. Instead of sending me just the replacement piece I needed, LETSCOM sent me an entire set of replacement bands. Thanks for a fine product and excellent customer service.
