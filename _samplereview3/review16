This tracker is amazing. It's beautiful, and easy to use. I'm not interested in bone up on electronic products, but I learned how to use this tracker in a walk. I use it almost 24 hours in a week without charge. The app has a excellent function that can track my sleeping quality, it can analyze deep sleep, light sleep and awake time for your personal review, which helps you to adjust your sleep time, habit, etc. to improve your sleep quality. The heart beat measurement is accurate. The water-resist design is a plus that I do not need to take it off even when I am washing my face.
